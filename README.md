# Provider Directories and Scheduling

Java code using the HAPI-FHIR (2.5) library created for the HL7 San Diego WGM 201709 Provider Directories and Scheduling Connectathon Track to demonstrate how FHIR can be used to standardize the exchange of services/provider directory data.

These examples make use of the opensource [JAVA FHIR API](https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/)
